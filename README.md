# 04_React_group_project
Project to build a React-based web application that allows users to manage a collection of items. 
Each user should be able to add new entries, view them in a visually appealing list, edit their details, and remove them when no longer needed. You may choose any type of data to manage, such as favorite books, recipes, travel destinations, movies, or songs. The goal is to create an engaging, user-friendly interface that encourages visitors to interact with the content and explore the various features.
